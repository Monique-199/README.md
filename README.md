# TeleHealth – UX Case Study

A user-friendly telehealth platform designed to help elderly users in Kenya book and attend doctor consultations independently.



## 📌 Project Overview

**TeleHealth** is a mobile telehealth experience focused on accessibility, simplicity, and reassurance for elderly users who may have limited experience with technology.

The project addresses common challenges faced by elderly users such as small text, complex interfaces, and fear of making mistakes when using digital healthcare platforms.



## 🎯 Problem

Many existing telehealth platforms are designed for tech-savvy users and do not adequately support elderly patients. This often results in confusion, reliance on caregivers, or complete avoidance of digital healthcare services.



## 💡 Solution

I designed a calm, guided telehealth experience that allows elderly users to:

- Book a doctor’s appointment with minimal steps  
- Join a scheduled consultation confidently  
- Review a clear summary after the visit  

The design prioritizes large text, clear actions, plain language, and reassurance at every step.
